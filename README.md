Webtalk is a real-time chat application built with AngularJS and Firebase.

In this application the list of chat rooms is listed on the left side of the screen. You can create chat rooms here as well. Just click the "New Room" button, name the room in the modal that pops up, and the room will appear in the list.

Once in a room, you need to set up your username. A modal will pop-up asking you your username and it will be stored in your cookies. The chat room messages will be displayed in the middle of the page. Each message will display the username of the sender and teh message. You can enter a new message at the bottom of the page.

This is a single-page basic chat application created to improve my knowledge of AngularJS and Firebase.
